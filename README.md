### Synopsis
This project investigates how effective a genetic algorithm will be given different environmental conditions. Specifically, I simulate thousands of simple neural network agents playing a version of the classic [prisoner's dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110513/utilizing-prisoners-dilemma-business-and-economy.asp) game. 


### Prisoner's Dilemma
In this game, two players must decide whether to betray the other or remain loyal.
- If both players betray on another, they are both punished moderately. 
- If neither betrays the other, they are both punished lightly. 
- If only one player betrays the other, the player that was betrayed will be punished severely, while the betrayer is not punished. 




In my simulation, pairs of agents play 20 rounds of the game, with the only information available to them being the outcome of the last round.
